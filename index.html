Although machine learning (ML) has attracted a lot of attention in the digital soil mapping (DSM) community for its powerful ability to learn from data and predict soil properties, such as SOC, it is better at capturing soil spatial variation than soil temporal dynamics. By contrast, process-oriented (PO) models benefit from mechanistic knowledge to express physiochemical and biological processes that govern SOC temporal changes. Therefore, integrating PO and ML models seems a promising means to represent physically plausible SOC dynamics while retaining the spatial prediction accuracy of ML models. In this study, a hybrid modelling framework was developed and tested for predicting topsoil SOC stock in space and time for a regional cropland area located in eastern China. In essence, the hybrid model uses predictions of the PO model in unsampled years as additional training data of the ML model, with a weighting parameter assigned to balance the importance of SOC values from the PO model and real measurements. The results indicated that temporal trends of SOC stock modelled by PO and ML models were largely different, while they were notably similar between the PO and hybrid models. Cross-validation showed that the hybrid model had the best performance (RMSE = 0.29 kg m−2), with a 19 % improvement compared with the ML model. We conclude that the proposed hybrid framework not only enhances space-time soil carbon mapping in terms of prediction accuracy and physical plausibility, it also provides insights for soil management and policy decisions in the face of future climate change and intensified human activities.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">IJGIS</abbr> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/publication_preview/cover_IJGIS-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/publication_preview/cover_IJGIS-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/publication_preview/cover_IJGIS-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="200px" type="image/webp"> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/cover_IJGIS.jpg" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="cover_IJGIS.jpg" data-zoomable loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </source></picture> </figure> </div> <div id="Zhang_IJGIS_2023" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">An adaptive uncertainty-guided sampling method for geospatial prediction and its application in digital soil mapping</div> <div class="author"> <em>Lei Zhang</em>, A-Xing Zhu, Junzhi Liu, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 3 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '3 more authors' ?

In this paper, we developed an adaptive uncertainty-guided stepwise sampling (AUGSS) method to select sampling locations to supplement existing legacy sample points whose representation should be improved. The proposed method selects supplemental samples in a stepwise manner as guided by an objective function with two weighted sub-objectives. One reduces the area with high prediction uncertainty, and the other minimizes the overall prediction uncertainty for the entire area. The method takes an adaptive approach to adjust weights for the two sub-objectives and to tune an uncertainty threshold controlling whether a location can be reliably predicted during the sampling procedure. A case study on soil property prediction shows that AUGSS outperforms the stratified random sampling (SRS) and the non-adaptive uncertainty guided sampling method (UGSS) in terms of RMSE and Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient with different sample sizes. This study shows that the AUGSS method offers a potential for effectively adding supplemental samples to existing samples which are insufficient for spatial prediction. The adaptive strategy guided by predicted uncertainty provides an efficient support to improve the spatial pattern of samples, which plays a key role in the result accuracy of geospatial predictive mapping.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">Geoderma</abbr> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/publication_preview/cover_Geoderma-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/publication_preview/cover_Geoderma-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/publication_preview/cover_Geoderma-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="200px" type="image/webp"> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/cover_Geoderma.jpg" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="cover_Geoderma.jpg" data-zoomable loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </source></picture> </figure> </div> <div id="Zhang_Geoderma_2022" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">A multiple soil properties oriented representative sampling strategy for digital soil mapping</div> <div class="author"> <em>Lei Zhang</em>, Lin Yang, Yanyan Cai, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 3 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '3 more authors' ?

Efficient sampling design for multiple soil properties is increasingly needed for multivariate soil survey and mapping. However, most of the present sampling methods are not developed for multiple soil properties. Different soil properties have different influential covariates, but usually only one set of covariates is used in designing samples for multiple soil properties which makes simultaneously mapping multiple soil properties accurately difficult. This paper proposed a multiple soil properties oriented representative sampling strategy (MPRS) by considering the influential environmental covariates for each soil property. The method first selects the most influential set of environmental covariates for each soil property, then uses fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering to generate environmental clusters relating to spatial variation patterns for each soil property, and the selected samples are representative of as many typical locations of environmental clusters for multiple soil properties as possible. The proposed sampling method was applied for mapping soil sand content and soil organic matter content at surface (0–20 cm) and subsurface (20–40 cm) layers in a study area with 5900 km2 located in Anhui Province, China, and compared with two methods, the purposive sampling (PS) method and integrative hierarchical stepwise sampling (IHS) method. The results showed that the proposed sampling method achieved the most accurate prediction for most of the four soil properties over different sample sizes. The proposed sampling method also has an advantage to extract representative samples which can better cover multiple soil properties with a limit of a small sample size. On average, the improvement of prediction accuracy by using the MPRS method was 38.1% and 36.3% compared with PS and IHS in terms of R2, 4.8% and 4.6% in terms of RMSE, and 11.7% and 13.7% in terms of CCC, respectively. Our case study confirmed the necessity to consider the difference of the influential environmental variable combinations for the multiple soil properties oriented sampling design. We conclude that MPRS is a potential effective method for supporting DSM for multiple soil properties.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">Science Advances</abbr> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/publication_preview/cover_SA-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/publication_preview/cover_SA-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/publication_preview/cover_SA-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="200px" type="image/webp"> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/cover_SA.jpg" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="cover_SA.jpg" data-zoomable loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </source></picture> </figure> </div> <div id="Zhang_SA_2022" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Direct and indirect impacts of urbanization on vegetation growth across the world’s cities</div> <div class="author"> <em>Lei Zhang</em>, Lin Yang, Constantin M.

Because of limited ground-based experiments, the responses of vegetation to urbanization and its associated controlling factors at the global scale remain poorly understood. Here, we use satellite observations from 2001 to 2018 to quantify direct and indirect impacts of urbanization on vegetation growth in 672 worldwide cities. After controlling for the negative direct impact of urbanization on vegetation growth, we find a widespread positive indirect effect that has been increasing over time. These indirect effects depend on urban development intensity, population density, and background climate, with more pronounced positive effects in cities with cold and arid environments. We further show that vegetation responses to urbanization are modulated by a cities’ developmental status. Our findings have important implications for understanding urbanization-induced impacts on vegetation and future sustainable urban development.

Therefore, the better monitoring of soil carbon in cropland is helpful for carbon sequestration and sustainable soil management. However, severe anthropogenic disturbance in cropland mainly in gentle terrain creates uncertainty in obtaining accurate soil information with limited sample data. Within the past 20 years, digital soil mapping has been recognized as a promising technology in mapping soil carbon. Herein, to advance existing knowledge and highlight new directions, the article reviews the research on mapping soil carbon in cropland from 2005 to 2021. There is a significant shift from linear statistical models to machine learning models because nonlinear models may be more efficient in explaining the complex soil-environment relationship. Climate covariates and parent material play an important role in soil carbon on the regional scale, while on a local scale, the variability of soil carbon often depends on topography, agricultural management, and soil properties. Recently, several kinds of agricultural covariates have been explored in mapping soil carbon based on survey or remote sensing technique, while, obtaining agricultural covariates with high resolution remains a challenge. Based on the review, we concluded several challenges in three categories: sampling, agricultural covariates, and representation of soil processes in models. We thus propose a conceptual framework with four future strategies: representative sampling strategies, establishing standardized monitoring and sharing system to acquire more efficient crop management information, exploring time-series sensing data, as well as integrating pedological knowledge into predictive models. It is intended that this review will support prospective researchers by providing knowledge clusters and gaps concerning the digital mapping of soil carbon in cropland.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">Geoderma</abbr> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/publication_preview/cover_Geoderma-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/publication_preview/cover_Geoderma-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/publication_preview/cover_Geoderma-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="200px" type="image/webp"> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/cover_Geoderma.jpg" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="cover_Geoderma.jpg" data-zoomable loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </source></picture> </figure> </div> <div id="Zhang_Geoderma_2021" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">A self-training semi-supervised machine learning method for predictive mapping of soil classes with limited sample data</div> <div class="author"> <em>Lei Zhang</em>, Lin Yang, Tianwu Ma, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 3 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '3 more authors' ?

Most machine learning models are trained with a supervised learning (SL) method based on training samples. However, the collected sample data is often limited in practice due to that field sampling is expensive and time-consuming. The insufficient samples may limit the learning ability of the model to a large extent. Semi-supervised machine learning, a new machine learning paradigm that makes use of both unsampled data and a small amount of sampled data in the learning process, can be a potential effective method for DSM. In this study, we present a self-training semi-supervised learning (SSL) method for DSM. Different with the SL method for machine learning models, the SSL method not only utilizes the sampled locations but also the abundant environmental covariate information at the unvisited locations. Its basic idea is to iteratively enlarge the training data set by adding the unsampled points with high prediction confidence from the unvisited locations until a stopping criterion reached. The proposed SSL method was applied in machine learning models for predicting soil classes in Heshan Farm of Nenjiang County in Hei­ longjiang Province, China. Three machine learning models, including multinomial logistic regression (MLR), knearest neighbor (KNN) and random forest (RF), were selected to evaluate the efficiency of the SSL method. The entropy threshold was an important parameter in the SSL method, and a sensitivity analysis on this parameter was conducted with using a series of entropy thresholds. The SSL method was compared with the SL method for the three machine learning models for soil prediction. A cross-validation was employed to evaluate the accuracy of the predicted soil class maps generated based on each method. The results showed that the prediction ac­ curacies (the proportion of the correctly predicted samples over the total number of validation samples) of the SSL method were higher than those of the SL method for MLR, KNN, and RF by 5.9%, 12.2%, and 6.0%, respectively. RF-SSL was the most accurate model in the study area, followed by KNN-SSL. Meanwhile, the selftraining SSL method for the KNN model had the largest improvement comparing with the other two models. Furthermore, the predicted soil maps using the SSL method showed a more reasonable spatial variation pattern of soil classes. In the study area, a suitable value of the entropy threshold was 0.8 ~ 1.0. We concluded that the SSL method improved the soil prediction accuracy compared with the SL method when applying machine learning models for DSM, and thus is a potential efficient method for DSM with limit sample data.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">JCP</abbr> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/publication_preview/cover_JCP-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/publication_preview/cover_JCP-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/publication_preview/cover_JCP-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="200px" type="image/webp"> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/cover_JCP.jpg" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="cover_JCP.jpg" data-zoomable loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </source></picture> </figure> </div> <div id="Yang_JCP_2021" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Quantifying influences of natural and anthropogenic factors on vegetation changes using structural equation modeling: A case study in Jiangsu Province, China</div> <div class="author"> Lin Yang, Feixue Shen, <em>Lei Zhang</em>, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 3 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '3 more authors' ?

However, the major driving factor of vegetation coverage change in these areas remains unclear, with climate change and anthropogenic factors playing interactive roles under different soil and terrain conditions. Comprehensively understanding the underlying drivers of vegetation change can provide references for regulating environmental management and prevention of vegetation degradation. In this paper, a structural equation modeling (SEM) method was employed to quantify the effects of fundamental natural environment (i.e. the relative stable variables including soil and topography), climate change and human activity change on vegetation coverage change in Jiangsu province, China from 2000 to 2015. Four variables including land use, population density, road impact and night lights were used to indicate human activities. The results showed that the increase of NDVI smaller than 0.10 covered 39.13% of the study area while the decrease of NDVI larger than 0.10 accounted for 20.23%. Areas with NDVI increase mainly distributed in croplands in northern Jiangsu. This could be explained by the increase of crop yield due to the development of modern agriculture. The decrease of NDVI was mainly observed in southern Jiangsu with higher urbanization level and city centers in northern Jiangsu, indicating the effect of rapid urbanization on vegetation degradation. The constructed SEM model suggested that the total effects (influential coefficients) of fundamental natural environment, climate change, and human activity change on NDVI change in Jiangsu were −0.24, 0.17, and −0.74, respectively. Although the fundamental natural environment didn’t have a direct effect on NDVI change, but it had an indirect effect through interactions with human activities. We also constructed SEM models for northern and southern Jiangsu separately, due to their different natural environment and changing patterns of climate change. The results indicated the different driving mechanisms of NDVI change in northern and southern Jiangsu. Furthermore, the results suggested night light as the best indicator of human activity change, followed by the road impact index. We concluded that our study offered a framework to better understand and explain the complex interrelationships behind the spatial temporal change of NDVI.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">JAG</abbr> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/publication_preview/cover_JAG-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/publication_preview/cover_JAG-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/publication_preview/cover_JAG-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="200px" type="image/webp"> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/cover_JAG.jpg" class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" width="100%" height="auto" alt="cover_JAG.jpg" data-zoomable loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </source></picture> </figure> </div> <div id="Yang_JAG_2021" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">A deep learning method to predict soil organic carbon content at a regional scale using satellite-based phenology variables</div> <div class="author"> Lin Yang, Yanyan Cai, <em>Lei Zhang</em>, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 3 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '3 more authors' ?

Digital soil mapping of SOC at a regional scale is challenging due to the complex SOC-environment relationships. Vegetation phenology that directly indicates a long time vegetation growth characteristics can be potential environmental covariates for SOC prediction. Deep learning has been developed for soil mapping recently due to its ability of constructing high-level features from the raw data. However, only dozens of predictors were used in most of those studies. It is not clear that how deep learning with long term land surface phenology product performs for SOC prediction at a regional scale. This paper explored the effectiveness of ten-years MODIS MCD12Q2 phenology variables for SOC prediction with a convolutional neural network (CNN) model in Anhui province, China. Random forest (RF) was applied to compare with CNN using three groups of environmental variables. The results showed that adding the land surface phenology variables into the pool of the natural environmental variables improved the prediction accuracy of CNN by 5.57% of RMSE and 31.29% of R2. Adding phenology variables obtained a higher accuracy improvement than adding Normalized Differences Vegetation Indices. The CNN obtained a higher prediction accuracy than RF regardless of using which group of variables. This study proved that land surface phenology metrics were effective predictors and CNN was a promising method for soil mapping at a regional scale.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> </div> <div class="social"> <div class="contact-icons"> <a href="mailto:%6C%65%69.%7A%68%61%6E%67.%67%65%6F@%6F%75%74%6C%6F%6F%6B.%63%6F%6D" title="email"><i class="fa-solid fa-envelope"></i></a> <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1090-6338" title="ORCID" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><i class="ai ai-orcid"></i></a> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aCKgi18AAAAJ&amp;hl" title="Google Scholar" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><i class="ai ai-google-scholar"></i></a> <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lei-Zhang-360/" title="ResearchGate" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><i class="ai ai-researchgate"></i></a> <a href="https://github.com/leizhang-geo" title="GitHub" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><i class="fa-brands fa-github"></i></a> <a href="/feed.xml" title="RSS Feed"><i class="fa-solid fa-square-rss"></i></a> </div> <div class="contact-note">A researcher exploring in the jungle. </div> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 Lei Zhang.
