  abstract = {Monitoring and modelling soil organic carbon (SOC) in space and time can help us to better understand soil carbon dynamics and is of key importance to support climate change research and policy. Although machine learning (ML) has attracted a lot of attention in the digital soil mapping (DSM) community for its powerful ability to learn from data and predict soil properties, such as SOC, it is better at capturing soil spatial variation than soil temporal dynamics. By contrast, process-oriented (PO) models benefit from mechanistic knowledge to express physiochemical and biological processes that govern SOC temporal changes. Therefore, integrating PO and ML models seems a promising means to represent physically plausible SOC dynamics while retaining the spatial prediction accuracy of ML models. In this study, a hybrid modelling framework was developed and tested for predicting topsoil SOC stock in space and time for a regional cropland area located in eastern China. In essence, the hybrid model uses predictions of the PO model in unsampled years as additional training data of the ML model, with a weighting parameter assigned to balance the importance of SOC values from the PO model and real measurements. The results indicated that temporal trends of SOC stock modelled by PO and ML models were largely different, while they were notably similar between the PO and hybrid models. Cross-validation showed that the hybrid model had the best performance (RMSE = 0.29 kg m−2), with a 19 % improvement compared with the ML model. We conclude that the proposed hybrid framework not only enhances space-time soil carbon mapping in terms of prediction accuracy and physical plausibility, it also provides insights for soil management and policy decisions in the face of future climate change and intensified human activities.},

  abstract = {Multiple natural and anthropogenic factors jointly drive the spatial distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) and its dynamics in croplands. Among these factors, agricultural management practices have caused considerable impacts. Previous studies on the driving factors of SOC in croplands have provided significant understanding on this matter. However, whether and how the effects and interplay of these drivers change over time is often unknown, especially agricultural activities. To measure the effects of agricultural management practices on the spatial distribution and temporal change of SOC incorporating the network relationships with other natural drivers at the regional scale, we conducted partial least squares path analysis on the topsoil organic carbon content using two historical soil datasets from cropland samples in East China obtained during the 1980s and the 2010s. Eight indicators and their temporal changes reflecting climate, agricultural management, and edaphic conditions were used to quantify the driving mechanisms of the spatial distribution and temporal change of SOC. The drivers of SOC distribution showed that high SOC was mostly distributed in soils with a relatively low pH and high clay content in warm humid climates. High SOC was associated with the application of N fertilizer, crop residue input, and agricultural machinery in the 1980s and 2010s. The effect of N fertilization on SOC distribution increased from the 1980s to the 2010s, whereas the total edaphic effects significantly decreased from 0.62 to 0.25 (P {\textless} 0.01). Regarding the drivers of SOC change over the three decades, the edaphic effects presented the strongest effect (path coefficient of 0.74, P {\textless} 0.01), including the negative effects of topsoil acidity and baseline SOC level, as well as the positive effects of total nitrogen (TN) and clay content change. Croplands with lower intensity of management practices in the 1980s generally attained more development in agricultural modernization, which led to a considerable SOC increase. Our research revealed the importance of agricultural management practices on the spatial distribution and temporal change of cropland SOC at the regional scale. The results emphasize the need to measure the changing driving mechanisms of SOC dynamics. The findings indicate that indicators reflecting the effects of agricultural management practices should be included in digital mapping and process-based modeling of soil carbon at different spatiotemporal scales to improve prediction accuracy.},

  abstract = {Sampling design can significantly reduce the uncertainty in geospatial predictions. In this paper, we developed an adaptive uncertainty-guided stepwise sampling (AUGSS) method to select sampling locations to supplement existing legacy sample points whose representation should be improved. The proposed method selects supplemental samples in a stepwise manner as guided by an objective function with two weighted sub-objectives. One reduces the area with high prediction uncertainty, and the other minimizes the overall prediction uncertainty for the entire area. The method takes an adaptive approach to adjust weights for the two sub-objectives and to tune an uncertainty threshold controlling whether a location can be reliably predicted during the sampling procedure. A case study on soil property prediction shows that AUGSS outperforms the stratified random sampling (SRS) and the non-adaptive uncertainty guided sampling method (UGSS) in terms of RMSE and Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient with different sample sizes. This study shows that the AUGSS method offers a potential for effectively adding supplemental samples to existing samples which are insufficient for spatial prediction. The adaptive strategy guided by predicted uncertainty provides an efficient support to improve the spatial pattern of samples, which plays a key role in the result accuracy of geospatial predictive mapping.},

	abstract = {Generating accurate spatial information on soil organic matter (SOM) is increasingly important in the context of global environmental change. Both prediction models and environmental covariates influence the mapping results and accuracy, making them important factors in SOM mapping. The Bayesian spatial model INLA-SPDE is an emerging model, that has shown potential in digital soil mapping (DSM), but its application is still limited. Soil moisture, which affects soil water status and the decomposition of SOM, can be a potential predictor for mapping SOM. However, the difficulty of obtaining soil moisture measurements over a large area using ground-based methods hinders its application. Recently, high spatial resolution remote sensing (RS) has provided a possible way to generate soil moisture indices over a large area. However, the effectiveness of RS-based soil moisture indices on SOM mapping is unknown. Fourier transforms decomposed (FTD) variables based on vegetation indices have been proven effective in detecting time-series patterns of crop growth, thereby improving the mapping accuracy of farmland. Yet, the effectiveness of FTD variables has not been verified in other vegetation-covered areas. This paper examines the use of INLA-SPDE with three RS-based soil moisture indices (NSDSIs) and six FTD variables for SOM mapping compared to Random Forest (RF), in a study area with diverse vegetation cover in Anhui Province, China. The finding indicates that with the optimal combination of environmental covariates, INLA-SPDE yields a higher prediction accuracy than RF, with an increase of 18\% in R2. Either the RS-based soil moisture indices covariates or the FTD variables are effective in mapping SOM. When compared to using only natural environmental covariates, the best combination including RS-based soil moisture indices and FTD variables improved the mapping accuracy by 25\% in terms of R2, 21\% of LCCC, and 11\% of RMSE. Furthermore, quantitative prediction uncertainty maps are derived based on the INLA-SPDE. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of INLA-SPDE model with the RS-based soil moisture indices and Fourier transforms decomposed variables for SOM mapping.},

It is well known that land use type and its transformation affect vegetation change. However, how the changes in land use intensity (LUI) within different land use types impact vegetation and the interactions with other drivers remain poorly understood. We measured the LUI of Jiangsu Province, China, within the main land use types in 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2018 by combining remote sensing-based land use data with representative county scale economic and social indicators. Structural equation models (SEMs) were built to quantify the influences of long term LUI on vegetation change interacting with economic development, climate change and topographical conditions in transformed land, cropland, rural settlements and urbanized land, respectively. Seventy percent of significant vegetation change existed in non-transformed land use types. Although the area with a vegetation greening trend is larger than that with a vegetation browning trend, the vegetation browning areas is prominent in urbanized lands and some croplands in south basins. The constructed SEMs suggested the dominant negative effect of fast economic development regardless of land use types, while LUI played important and different direct and indirect effects on affecting vegetation change significantly interacting with economic development and climate change in different land use types. The LUI increasing led a vegetation greening in cropland, and stronger than climate warming with both positive direct and indirect effects for influencing climate change. The LUI change took negative effects on vegetation change in rural and urban areas, while a positive indirect effect of LUI increasing in urbanized land signaled the positive results of human managements. We then provided some land use-specific suggestions on basin scale for land management in Jiangsu. Our results highlight the necessity of long-term LUI quantification and promote the understanding of its effects on vegetation change interacted with other drivers within different land use types. This can be very helpful for sustainable land use and managements in regions with fast economic development.},

  abstract = {Sampling design plays a key role in digital soil mapping (DSM). Efficient sampling design for multiple soil properties is increasingly needed for multivariate soil survey and mapping. However, most of the present sampling methods are not developed for multiple soil properties. Different soil properties have different influential covariates, but usually only one set of covariates is used in designing samples for multiple soil properties which makes simultaneously mapping multiple soil properties accurately difficult. This paper proposed a multiple soil properties oriented representative sampling strategy (MPRS) by considering the influential environmental covariates for each soil property. The method first selects the most influential set of environmental covariates for each soil property, then uses fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering to generate environmental clusters relating to spatial variation patterns for each soil property, and the selected samples are representative of as many typical locations of environmental clusters for multiple soil properties as possible. The proposed sampling method was applied for mapping soil sand content and soil organic matter content at surface (0–20 cm) and subsurface (20–40 cm) layers in a study area with 5900 km2 located in Anhui Province, China, and compared with two methods, the purposive sampling (PS) method and integrative hierarchical stepwise sampling (IHS) method. The results showed that the proposed sampling method achieved the most accurate prediction for most of the four soil properties over different sample sizes. The proposed sampling method also has an advantage to extract representative samples which can better cover multiple soil properties with a limit of a small sample size. On average, the improvement of prediction accuracy by using the MPRS method was 38.1% and 36.3% compared with PS and IHS in terms of R2, 4.8% and 4.6% in terms of RMSE, and 11.7% and 13.7% in terms of CCC, respectively. Our case study confirmed the necessity to consider the difference of the influential environmental variable combinations for the multiple soil properties oriented sampling design. We conclude that MPRS is a potential effective method for supporting DSM for multiple soil properties.},

Because of limited ground-based experiments, the responses of vegetation to urbanization and its associated controlling factors at the global scale remain poorly understood. Here, we use satellite observations from 2001 to 2018 to quantify direct and indirect impacts of urbanization on vegetation growth in 672 worldwide cities. After controlling for the negative direct impact of urbanization on vegetation growth, we find a widespread positive indirect effect that has been increasing over time. These indirect effects depend on urban development intensity, population density, and background climate, with more pronounced positive effects in cities with cold and arid environments. We further show that vegetation responses to urbanization are modulated by a cities’ developmental status. Our findings have important implications for understanding urbanization-induced impacts on vegetation and future sustainable urban development. Positive indirect effects of global urbanization on vegetation growth partially offset the negative direct impact.},

	abstract = {The spatial distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) serves as critical geographic information for assessing ecosystem services, climate change mitigation, and optimal agriculture management. Digital mapping of SOC is challenging due to the complex relationships between the soil and its environment. Except for the well-known terrain and climate environmental covariates, vegetation that interacts with soils influences SOC significantly over long periods. Although several remote-sensing-based vegetation indices have been widely adopted in digital soil mapping, variables indicating long term vegetation growth have been less used. Vegetation phenology, an indicator of vegetation growth characteristics, can be used as a potential time series environmental covariate for SOC prediction. A CNN-LSTM model was developed for SOC prediction with inputs of static and dynamic environmental variables in Xuancheng City, China. The spatially contextual features in static variables (e.g., topographic variables) were extracted by the convolutional neural network (CNN), while the temporal features in dynamic variables (e.g., vegetation phenology over a long period of time) were extracted by a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. The ten-year phenological variables derived from moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations were adopted as predictors with historical temporal changes in vegetation in addition to the commonly used static variables. The random forest (RF) model was used as a reference model for comparison. Our results indicate that adding phenological variables can produce a more accurate map, as tested by the five-fold cross-validation, and demonstrate that CNN-LSTM is a potentially effective model for predicting SOC at a regional spatial scale with long-term historical vegetation phenology information as an extra input. We highlight the great potential of hybrid deep learning models, which can simultaneously extract spatial and temporal features from different types of environmental variables, for future applications in digital soil mapping.},

	abstract = {Cropland soil carbon not only serves food security but also contributes to the stability of the terrestrial ecosystem carbon pool due to the strong interconnection with atmospheric carbon dioxide. Therefore, the better monitoring of soil carbon in cropland is helpful for carbon sequestration and sustainable soil management. However, severe anthropogenic disturbance in cropland mainly in gentle terrain creates uncertainty in obtaining accurate soil information with limited sample data. Within the past 20 years, digital soil mapping has been recognized as a promising technology in mapping soil carbon. Herein, to advance existing knowledge and highlight new directions, the article reviews the research on mapping soil carbon in cropland from 2005 to 2021. There is a significant shift from linear statistical models to machine learning models because nonlinear models may be more efficient in explaining the complex soil-environment relationship. Climate covariates and parent material play an important role in soil carbon on the regional scale, while on a local scale, the variability of soil carbon often depends on topography, agricultural management, and soil properties. Recently, several kinds of agricultural covariates have been explored in mapping soil carbon based on survey or remote sensing technique, while, obtaining agricultural covariates with high resolution remains a challenge. Based on the review, we concluded several challenges in three categories: sampling, agricultural covariates, and representation of soil processes in models. We thus propose a conceptual framework with four future strategies: representative sampling strategies, establishing standardized monitoring and sharing system to acquire more efficient crop management information, exploring time-series sensing data, as well as integrating pedological knowledge into predictive models. It is intended that this review will support prospective researchers by providing knowledge clusters and gaps concerning the digital mapping of soil carbon in cropland.},

High spatial resolution images can help provide detailed large spatial coverage at high resolution information on coastal zones.

The results showed that natural and artificial coastlines in the YRD region accounted for 42.73\% and 57.27\% in 2013 and 41.56\% and 58.44\% in 2018, respectively. The coastline generally advanced towards the sea, causing a land area increase of 475.62 km2. The changes in the YRD coastline mainly resulted from a combination of large-scale artificial construction and natural factors such as silt deposition.

	abstract = {Numerous machine learning models have been developed for constructing the relationship between soil classes or properties and its environmental covariates in digital soil mapping (DSM). Most machine learning models are trained with a supervised learning (SL) method based on training samples. However, the collected sample data is often limited in practice due to that field sampling is expensive and time-consuming. The insufficient samples may limit the learning ability of the model to a large extent. Semi-supervised machine learning, a new machine learning paradigm that makes use of both unsampled data and a small amount of sampled data in the learning process, can be a potential effective method for DSM. In this study, we present a self-training semi-supervised learning (SSL) method for DSM. Different with the SL method for machine learning models, the SSL method not only utilizes the sampled locations but also the abundant environmental covariate information at the unvisited locations. Its basic idea is to iteratively enlarge the training data set by adding the unsampled points with high prediction confidence from the unvisited locations until a stopping criterion reached. The proposed SSL method was applied in machine learning models for predicting soil classes in Heshan Farm of Nenjiang County in Hei­ longjiang Province, China. Three machine learning models, including multinomial logistic regression (MLR), knearest neighbor (KNN) and random forest (RF), were selected to evaluate the efficiency of the SSL method. The entropy threshold was an important parameter in the SSL method, and a sensitivity analysis on this parameter was conducted with using a series of entropy thresholds. The SSL method was compared with the SL method for the three machine learning models for soil prediction. A cross-validation was employed to evaluate the accuracy of the predicted soil class maps generated based on each method. The results showed that the prediction ac­ curacies (the proportion of the correctly predicted samples over the total number of validation samples) of the SSL method were higher than those of the SL method for MLR, KNN, and RF by 5.9\%, 12.2\%, and 6.0\%, respectively. RF-SSL was the most accurate model in the study area, followed by KNN-SSL. Meanwhile, the selftraining SSL method for the KNN model had the largest improvement comparing with the other two models. Furthermore, the predicted soil maps using the SSL method showed a more reasonable spatial variation pattern of soil classes. In the study area, a suitable value of the entropy threshold was 0.8 {\textasciitilde} 1.0. We concluded that the SSL method improved the soil prediction accuracy compared with the SL method when applying machine learning models for DSM, and thus is a potential efficient method for DSM with limit sample data.},

	abstract = {Air pollution in Northeastern Asia is a serious environmental problem, especially in China where PM2.5 levels are quite high. Accurate PM2.5 predictions are significant to environmental management and human health. Recently, deep learning has received increasing attention from relevant researchers. In this work, a spatiotemporal causal convolutional neural network (ST-CausalConvNet) for short-term PM2.5 prediction is proposed. The distinguishing characteristics of the proposed model is that the convolutions in the model architecture are causal, where an output at a certain time step is convolved only with elements from the same or earlier time steps in the previous layer. Accordingly, no information leakage is induced from the future to the past in this model. The spatial dependence between multiple monitoring stations was also considered in the model. Spatiotemporal correlation analysis was performed to select relevant information from monitoring stations that have a high relationship with the target station. The information from the target and related stations were then employed as the inputs and fed into the model. A case study from May 1, 2014 to April 30, 2015 in Beijing, China was conducted. The next hour PM2.5 concentration was predicted by the proposed model by using historical air quality and meteorological data from 36 monitoring stations. Experimental results show that the trends of the predicted PM2.5 concentrations and the observed values were consistent. The proposed method achieved a better prediction performance than the other three comparative models, namely artificial neural network (ANN), gated recurrent unit (GRU), and long short-term memory (LSTM). Furthermore, the effects of the important parameters and the model transferability were also conducted. We conclude that the proposed ST-CausalConvNet is a potential effective model for air pollution forecasting.},

	abstract = {Vegetation coverage in highly developed areas has been significantly altered in response to multiple disturbances over recent decades. However, the major driving factor of vegetation coverage change in these areas remains unclear, with climate change and anthropogenic factors playing interactive roles under different soil and terrain conditions. Comprehensively understanding the underlying drivers of vegetation change can provide references for regulating environmental management and prevention of vegetation degradation. In this paper, a structural equation modeling (SEM) method was employed to quantify the effects of fundamental natural environment (i.e. the relative stable variables including soil and topography), climate change and human activity change on vegetation coverage change in Jiangsu province, China from 2000 to 2015. Four variables including land use, population density, road impact and night lights were used to indicate human activities. The results showed that the increase of NDVI smaller than 0.10 covered 39.13\% of the study area while the decrease of NDVI larger than 0.10 accounted for 20.23\%. Areas with NDVI increase mainly distributed in croplands in northern Jiangsu. This could be explained by the increase of crop yield due to the development of modern agriculture. The decrease of NDVI was mainly observed in southern Jiangsu with higher urbanization level and city centers in northern Jiangsu, indicating the effect of rapid urbanization on vegetation degradation. The constructed SEM model suggested that the total effects (influential coefficients) of fundamental natural environment, climate change, and human activity change on NDVI change in Jiangsu were −0.24, 0.17, and −0.74, respectively. Although the fundamental natural environment didn’t have a direct effect on NDVI change, but it had an indirect effect through interactions with human activities. We also constructed SEM models for northern and southern Jiangsu separately, due to their different natural environment and changing patterns of climate change. The results indicated the different driving mechanisms of NDVI change in northern and southern Jiangsu. Furthermore, the results suggested night light as the best indicator of human activity change, followed by the road impact index. We concluded that our study offered a framework to better understand and explain the complex interrelationships behind the spatial temporal change of NDVI.},

	abstract = {Legacy ecoregion maps contain knowledge on relationships between eco-region units and their environmental factors. This study proposes a method to extract knowledge from legacy area-class maps to formulate a set of fuzzy membership functions useful for regionalization. We develop a buffer zone approach to reduce the uncertainty of boundaries between eco-region units on area-class maps. We generate buffer zones with a Euclidean distance perpendicular to the boundaries, then the original eco-region units without buffer zones serve as the basic units to generate the probability density functions (PDF) of environmental variables. Then, we transform the PDFs to fuzzy membership functions for class-zones on the map. We demonstrate the proposed method with a climatic zone map of China. The results showed that the buffer zone approach effectively reduced the uncertainties of boundaries. A buffer distance of 10–15 km was recommended in this study. The climatic zone map generated based on the extracted fuzzy membership functions showed a higher spatial stratification heterogeneity (compared to the original map). Based on the fuzzy membership functions with climate data of 1961–2015, we also prepared an updated climatic zone map. This study demonstrates the prospects of using fuzzy membership functions to delineate area classes for regionalization purpose.},

	abstract = {Obtaining the spatial distribution information of soil organic carbon (SOC) is significant to quantify the carbon budget and guide land management for migrating carbon emissions. Digital soil mapping of SOC at a regional scale is challenging due to the complex SOC-environment relationships. Vegetation phenology that directly indicates a long time vegetation growth characteristics can be potential environmental covariates for SOC prediction. Deep learning has been developed for soil mapping recently due to its ability of constructing high-level features from the raw data. However, only dozens of predictors were used in most of those studies. It is not clear that how deep learning with long term land surface phenology product performs for SOC prediction at a regional scale. This paper explored the effectiveness of ten-years MODIS MCD12Q2 phenology variables for SOC prediction with a convolutional neural network (CNN) model in Anhui province, China. Random forest (RF) was applied to compare with CNN using three groups of environmental variables. The results showed that adding the land surface phenology variables into the pool of the natural environmental variables improved the prediction accuracy of CNN by 5.57\% of RMSE and 31.29\% of R2. Adding phenology variables obtained a higher accuracy improvement than adding Normalized Differences Vegetation Indices. The CNN obtained a higher prediction accuracy than RF regardless of using which group of variables. This study proved that land surface phenology metrics were effective predictors and CNN was a promising method for soil mapping at a regional scale.},
