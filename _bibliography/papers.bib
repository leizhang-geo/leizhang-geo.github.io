  abstract = {Monitoring and modelling soil organic carbon (SOC) in space and time can help us to better understand soil carbon dynamics and is of key importance to support climate change research and policy. Although machine learning (ML) has attracted a lot of attention in the digital soil mapping (DSM) community for its powerful ability to learn from data and predict soil properties, such as SOC, it is better at capturing soil spatial variation than soil temporal dynamics. By contrast, process-oriented (PO) models benefit from mechanistic knowledge to express physiochemical and biological processes that govern SOC temporal changes. Therefore, integrating PO and ML models seems a promising means to represent physically plausible SOC dynamics while retaining the spatial prediction accuracy of ML models. In this study, a hybrid modelling framework was developed and tested for predicting topsoil SOC stock in space and time for a regional cropland area located in eastern China. In essence, the hybrid model uses predictions of the PO model in unsampled years as additional training data of the ML model, with a weighting parameter assigned to balance the importance of SOC values from the PO model and real measurements. The results indicated that temporal trends of SOC stock modelled by PO and ML models were largely different, while they were notably similar between the PO and hybrid models. Cross-validation showed that the hybrid model had the best performance (RMSE = 0.29 kg m−2), with a 19 % improvement compared with the ML model. We conclude that the proposed hybrid framework not only enhances space-time soil carbon mapping in terms of prediction accuracy and physical plausibility, it also provides insights for soil management and policy decisions in the face of future climate change and intensified human activities.},

  abstract = {Sampling design plays a key role in digital soil mapping (DSM). Efficient sampling design for multiple soil properties is increasingly needed for multivariate soil survey and mapping. However, most of the present sampling methods are not developed for multiple soil properties. Different soil properties have different influential covariates, but usually only one set of covariates is used in designing samples for multiple soil properties which makes simultaneously mapping multiple soil properties accurately difficult. This paper proposed a multiple soil properties oriented representative sampling strategy (MPRS) by considering the influential environmental covariates for each soil property. The method first selects the most influential set of environmental covariates for each soil property, then uses fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering to generate environmental clusters relating to spatial variation patterns for each soil property, and the selected samples are representative of as many typical locations of environmental clusters for multiple soil properties as possible. The proposed sampling method was applied for mapping soil sand content and soil organic matter content at surface (0–20 cm) and subsurface (20–40 cm) layers in a study area with 5900 km2 located in Anhui Province, China, and compared with two methods, the purposive sampling (PS) method and integrative hierarchical stepwise sampling (IHS) method. The results showed that the proposed sampling method achieved the most accurate prediction for most of the four soil properties over different sample sizes. The proposed sampling method also has an advantage to extract representative samples which can better cover multiple soil properties with a limit of a small sample size. On average, the improvement of prediction accuracy by using the MPRS method was 38.1% and 36.3% compared with PS and IHS in terms of R2, 4.8% and 4.6% in terms of RMSE, and 11.7% and 13.7% in terms of CCC, respectively. Our case study confirmed the necessity to consider the difference of the influential environmental variable combinations for the multiple soil properties oriented sampling design. We conclude that MPRS is a potential effective method for supporting DSM for multiple soil properties.},

  abstract = {Urban environments, regarded as “harbingers” of future global change, may exert positive or negative impacts on urban vegetation growth. Because of limited ground-based experiments, the responses of vegetation to urbanization and its associated controlling factors at the global scale remain poorly understood. Here, we use satellite observations from 2001 to 2018 to quantify direct and indirect impacts of urbanization on vegetation growth in 672 worldwide cities. After controlling for the negative direct impact of urbanization on vegetation growth, we find a widespread positive indirect effect that has been increasing over time. These indirect effects depend on urban development intensity, population density, and background climate, with more pronounced positive effects in cities with cold and arid environments. We further show that vegetation responses to urbanization are modulated by a cities’ developmental status. Our findings have important implications for understanding urbanization-induced impacts on vegetation and future sustainable urban development. Positive indirect effects of global urbanization on vegetation growth partially offset the negative direct impact.},
